how to do better?
<br />
practice. you have to approach it like learning a new skill. push yourself slightly above your upper limit consistently and you will get better. if you push yourself too hard you will burnout. there is a balance of pushing yourself too hard and just hard enough to get peak improvement. I have had a lot a lot of practice.
